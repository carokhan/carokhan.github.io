## Solution
I had no idea where to start, so I just Googled the subject line. Conveniently, the first result was [this](https://lingojam.com/SymbolLanguageTranslator).

Pasting both lines in there reveals:
> Subject: i think my keyboard is broken
> 
> contents: i think my keyboard is broken. i was planning to tell you this but iæm not sure how you will read it. hopefully you can find a way. byuctf”********************************’
